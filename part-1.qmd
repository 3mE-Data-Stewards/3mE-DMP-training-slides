## Data management plan (DMP)

Document describing what will happen with...

- code
- data

...during the project, including

- [storage](#data-storage) and [backups](#data-backup)
- who has access

It also determines what happens to code/data after the project

- if it will be publicly available
- how long data will be stored for future (re)use
- who will have access to the data in the long term

## Research data {.center}

> .... data in the form of **facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or other research output is based.** It relates to data generated, collected, or used, during research projects, and in some cases may include the research output itself. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data, in many disciplines, may by necessity include the software, algorithm, model and/or parameters, used to arrive at the research outcome, in addition to the raw data that the software, algorithm or model is applied to.

## Project/data organisation

Look familiar?

![](img/messy-structure.png)

. . .

Can you walk away from your project for days, weeks, months,

and come back and know what everything is?

. . .

Spend some time thinking about how you will organise yourself.

Your future self will thank you...

## Project structure

Projects should be contained within folders in a meaningful place

```

    📁reports
      📄 results-of-analysis.Rmd
    📁publication
      📄 manuscript_v1.docx
```

. . .

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li> ✔️ Could be in home directory (`~/Documents/Project_name`)  </li>

## Project templates {.scrollable}

There are many pre-existing templates out there that can help you

Just be consistent and transparent

## File naming

I know, I know, could there BE a more boring topic...

It is pretty essential, though. Follow these rules and she'll be right 👍:

- Use dates where applicable: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601 format)
    + Use them at the beginning of the file name so it arranges by date
- Be descriptive, but brief
- Using a version number (not 'final' - there's no such thing as a final version...)
- Avoid spaces and special characters (exceptions: `_` and `-`)
    + separate related words with `-` and chunks with `_`
- Avoid case-sensitivity (SomE operAting SystEms cARE, some don't)

## File naming continued {.center}

Good examples:

`analysis01_descriptive-statistics.R`  
`analysis02_preregistered-analysis.py`  
`2009-01-01_original-analysis.R`

Bad examples:

`essay "romeo and juliet" draft01(1).docx`  
`1-April-2012 supervisor comments on final draft.docx`

## Version control {background-image="img/project-history.jpg" background-size="40%" background-position="80% 50%"}

By using a version control system (VCS - git is most widely used), you can:

- record changes to file(s) over time
- revert selected files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- compare changes over time
- see who last modified something, when, and more

:::


## Version control hosting services

### GitHub ![](img/GitHub-Mark-64px.png){.absolute top=46 right=840}

- Popular host for developing open-source (and closed-source) projects
- share with nobody (Microsoft), collaborators, everybody 
- Free account for individuals

<br>

### GitLab ![](img/gitlab-logo.png){.absolute top=310 right=840 width=64}

- Similar interface to GitHub
- TU Delft provides own server (secure for sensitive data)
- Share with nobody, collaborators, all TU Delft researchers, everybody
- Free account for individuals

## VCS hosting services {.center}

They are NOT a certified repository for long-term storage

They do NOT assign DOIs

. . .

They CAN be connected with certified repositories

Snapshots of the repo will be taken and assigned a DOI

## Documentation {.smaller}

**What to document**

- How to navigate the project
- How to (re-)use code and data

Ask yourself: can someone with access to your project folder, reproduce exactly
your findings?

<!-- incremental code content with `. . .` is broken when located below subheaders (h3+) - when subheader comes immediately after slide header??? -->

. . .

That someone may be your future self!

. . .

**In practice**

- Metadata embedded in files (instrument-specific)
- Paper or (preferably) electronic lab notebooks
- README file(s) in project folder
- Code annotation/software instructions
- Upload your data to repositories with discovery metadata
- Use disciplinary metadata standards (may or may not exist for your discipline)


## Documentation: Lab notebooks

Conventionally kept in physical notebooks in lab or PIs office

. . .

This has some limitations

- does not relocate easily
- depends on handwriting legibility
- often not standardised

## Documentation: Electronic lab notebooks {#documentation-3 background-image="img/e-labnotebooks.jpg" background-position="90% 30%" background-size="50%"}

Several beneficial functionalities

- text editor
- spreadsheet tools
- protocol templates
- lab inventories
- sharing/collaboration options
- lab equipment/workflow managers
- integration with other resources (e.g. SURFDrive, OneDrive, and GitHub)
- version controlled

## Documentation: README {#documentation-4 .scrollable}

File(s) (*.txt*, *.md*, *.pdf*) that are stored at the root of your project or data directory

Contain:

- Introductory information
    + context of project
- Data-specific information
    + download/access instructions
    + re-use and citation (license)
    + variable name and discription
    + units of measurement
    + codes and abbreviations
    + Methodology
        - methods for generating the data
        - methods for processing the data
        - or link to where this information can be found
- Code-specific information
    + installation/download instructions
    + re-use and citation (license)
    + Issue/bug reporting and contributing guidelines

## Metadata

Data about data

### Embedded metadata

**FASTQ** files - *.txt* format used in life sciences (bioinformatics in particular) which store information about nucleotide sequence

**TIFF** files - *.tiff* format often contain additional information about images and how these were recorded  

**FITS** files - file standard widely used in astronomy to store images and tables. FITS files contain a headers with metadata with information about the data            

Examples from https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/collect-and-document

## Spreadsheet organistion

Raw data... DO NOT TOUCH

Make a copy of the raw data to perform calculations and analysis

- or, ideally, use a scripting language and export derived data


## Spreadsheet organisation

One row per case

One column per variable

One cell per observation

Variable naming

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li> ✔️ use snake_case or camelCase </li>
    <li> ✔️ meaningful names (but short) </li>
    <li> ❌ No special characters or spaces </li>
    <li> ❌ start with letter (not number) </li>
</ul>

## Personal data {.scrollable}

What is considered personal data?

- "Personal Data" (GDPR, Article 4): any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person

- a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person

. . .

### Direct vs. indirect identifiers

**Direct identifiers:** information that relates specifically to an individual such as the individual’s residence. 

- name, address, BSN or other identifying number or code, telephone number, e-mail address, biometric record

. . .

**Indirect identifiers:** information that can be combined with other information to identify specific individuals
a combination of gender, birth date, geographic indicator and other descriptors. 
place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, employment information, medical information, education information, and financial information


## Working with personal data {.center}

Anyone working with human participants will have to submit an application to the [Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/human-research-ethics/hrec-approval-1-application).

For the application you will need to:

- Create an [informed consent form](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/informed-consent-templates-and-guide)
- Fill out the [HREC checklist](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Integriteitsbeleid/11_HRX-checklist%20for%20human%20research.docx)
- Create a Data Management Plan using the TUDelft template

## Working with personal data {.center}

. . .

Collect only what you need (and what you informed participants you would collect)

. . .

Access to personal data is restricted to only those who need to process them

. . .

Data should be stored in a secure location (e.g. Project Drive)

. . .

Informed consent forms should be securely stored

- paper forms: locked storage
- digital forms: encrypted and separated from the other personal data

## Working with personal data {.center}

### Anonymisation vs. pseudonymisation

**Pseudonymisation:** assign a unique participant number to each participant on the corresponding informed consent form or a separate key document. Use participant number (not their names), during data collection & analysis. This is not anonymization, since it is possible to trace each unique participant number to the corresponding participant.

- Key document needs to be stored in a separate and secure location (e.g. with the informed consent forms).

. . .

**Anonymisation:** Full anonymization is often difficult to achieve. It might be still possible to identify a specific individual by putting together indirect identifiers. Easier to achieve by data aggregation.

## Data ownership {.center}

As a general rule, TU Delft owns all research data generated by employees at TU Delft.

But funder of the project (either public or commercial) might impose ownership conditions.

Check whether existing relevant documents, such as grant/consortium agreement etc., specify: 

- Who is allowed to use the data?
- Can the data be made publicly available?
- What is the publication procedure?
- The [faculty contract managers](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/faculty-contract-management) can advise on these agreements

## Publishing software {background-image="img/software-license-compatibility.png" background-position="95% 50%" background-size="40%"}

### TU Delft policy on research software

- Can it be made open source?
  + If yes, TU Delft transfers copyright to you
  + If no, contact your data steward
- Apply pre-approved open source license
- Publish the software (e.g. GitHub/Lab + 4TU for DOI)
- Register software with [PURE](https://pure.tudelft.nl/admin)
  + If published in 4TU.ResearchData, this is done automatically

## Publishing software

### Commercial vs. open source

Can co-exist (e.g. RStudio, NextCloud, ownCloud, Linux distros)

- Software is open source, maintenance and support is profitable
- Free for individuals, commercial licenses
- Free basic model, proprietary advanced usage
