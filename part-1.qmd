## The plan!

{{< include _rdm-diagram.md >}}

## Data management plan (DMP)

Document describing what will happen with...

- code
- data

...during the project, including

- [storage](#data-storage) and [backups](#data-backup)
- who has access

It also determines what happens to code/data after the project

- if it will be publicly available
- how long data will be stored for future (re)use
- who will have access to the data in the long term

## Research data {.center}

> .... data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or other research output is based. It relates to data generated, collected, or used, during research projects, and in some cases may include the research output itself. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data, in many disciplines, may by necessity include the software, algorithm, model and/or parameters, used to arrive at the research outcome, in addition to the raw data that the software, algorithm or model is applied to.

## Project templates {.scrollable}

There are many pre-existing templates out there that can help you

Just be consistent and transparent

## File naming

I know, I know, could there BE a more boring topic...

It is pretty essential, though. Follow these rules and she'll be right 👍:

- Use dates where applicable: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601 format)
    + Use them at the beginning of the file name so it arranges by date
- Be descriptive, but brief
- Using a version number (not 'final' - there's no such thing as a final version...)
- Avoid spaces and special characters (exceptions: `_` and `-`)
    + separate related words with `-` and chunks with `_`
- Avoid case-sensitivity (SomE operAting SystEms cARE, some don't)

## File naming continued {.center}

Good examples:

`analysis01_descriptive-statistics.R`  
`analysis02_preregistered-analysis.py`  
`2009-01-01_original-analysis.R`

Bad examples:

`essay "romeo and juliet" draft01(1).docx`  
`1-April-2012 supervisor comments on final draft.docx`

[From <https://djnavarro.net/slides-project-structure/#1>]{style="font-size: x-small;"}


## Documentation {.smaller}

**What to document**

- How to navigate the project
- How to (re-)use code and data

Ask yourself: can someone with access to your project folder, reproduce exactly
your findings?

<!-- incremental code content with `. . .` is broken when located below subheaders (h3+) - when subheader comes immediately after slide header??? -->

. . .

That someone may be your future self!

<br>

. . .

**In practice**

- Metadata embedded in files (instrument-specific)
- Paper or (preferably) electronic lab notebooks
- README file(s) in project folder
- Code annotation/software instructions
- Upload your data to repositories with discovery metadata
- Use disciplinary metadata standards (may or may not exist for your discipline)


## Documentation: Lab notebooks

Conventionally kept in physical notebooks in lab or PIs office

. . .

This has some limitations

- does not relocate easily
- depends on handwriting legibility
- often not standardised

## Documentation: Electronic lab notebooks {#documentation-3 background-image="img/e-labnotebooks.jpg" background-position="90% 30%" background-size="50%"}

Several beneficial functionalities

- text editor
- spreadsheet tools
- protocol templates
- lab inventories
- sharing/collaboration options
- lab equipment/workflow managers
- integration with other resources (e.g. SURFDrive, OneDrive, and GitHub)
- version controlled

## Documentation: README {#documentation-4 .scrollable}

File(s) (*.txt*, *.md*, *.pdf*) that are stored at the root of your project or data directory

Contain:

- Introductory information
    + context of project
- Data-specific information
    + download/access instructions
    + re-use and citation (license)
    + variable name and discription
    + units of measurement
    + codes and abbreviations
    + Methodology
        - methods for generating the data
        - methods for processing the data
        - or link to where this information can be found
- Code-specific information
    + installation/download instructions
    + re-use and citation (license)
    + Issue/bug reporting and contributing guidelines

## Metadata

Data about data

### Embedded metadata

**FASTQ** files - *.txt* format used in life sciences (bioinformatics in particular) which store information about nucleotide sequence

**TIFF** files - *.tiff* format often contain additional information about images and how these were recorded  

**FITS** files - file standard widely used in astronomy to store images and tables. FITS files contain a headers with metadata with information about the data            

Examples from https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/collect-and-document

## Spreadsheet organistion

Raw data... [DO NOT TOUCH]{.fragment}

![GIPHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIP657aH5QRMkX3q/giphy.gif){width="450px"}

## Spreadsheet organistion

Raw data... DO NOT TOUCH

Make a copy of the raw data to perform calculations and analysis

- or, ideally, use a scripting language and export derived data


## Spreadsheet organisation

One row per case

One column per variable

One cell per observation

Variable naming

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li> ✔️ use snake_case or camelCase </li>
    <li> ✔️ meaningful names (but short) </li>
    <li> ❌ No special characters or spaces </li>
    <li> ❌ start with letter (not number) </li>
</ul>

## Version control {background-image="img/project-history.jpg" background-size="40%" background-position="80% 50%"}

By using a version control system (VCS - git is most widely used), you can:

- record changes to file(s) over time
- revert selected files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- compare changes over time
- see who last modified something, when, and more

## Data ownership {.center}

As a general rule, TU Delft owns all research data generated by employees at TU Delft.

But funder of the project (either public or commercial) might impose ownership conditions.

Check whether existing relevant documents, such as grant/consortium agreement etc., specify: 

- Who is allowed to use the data?
